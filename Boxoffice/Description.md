This is a data visualisation project using Plotly Python and Seaborn based on a Coursera guided project. The goal of the project is to explore data from themoviedb API to create engaging and insightful visualisations.

The project has several functions, including:
* Visualising revenue
* Visualising the relationship between film revenue and budget spent
* Determining whether having an official homepage affects revenue
* Distribution of languages
* Determining if film descriptions impact revenue
* Determining frequent words in film titles
