This project detects the presence of Parkinson's disease with XGBoost.

XGBoost is an open-source implementation of the gradient boosted library. It implements ML algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework.

This project shows examples of using Python libraries such as scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost, to build a machine learning model.

The following are the steps the project will undertake:
1. Load data
2. Get the features and labels
3. Scale the features
4. Split the dataset
5. Build XGBClassifier
6. Calculate the accuracy of the model
