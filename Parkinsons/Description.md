This project is just a simple demonstration of the ability to code in Python. This project shows examples of using Python libraries such as scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost, to build a machine learning model.

The aim of the project is to detect the presence of Parkinson's disease with an open-source Machine Learning algorithm under the Gradient Boosting framework library - XGBoost.

The following are the steps the project will undertake:
1. Load data
2. Get the features and labels
3. Scale the features
4. Split the dataset
5. Build XGBClassifier
6. Calculate the accuracy of the model
